# React and Web3 Demo app

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

It is aimed to be a simple demo application powered by Ethereum blockchain made for [demo and video tutorial series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFUCprf8_vm4Dw-k2YEQL7kmXDsvPfbej) about React, Web3 and Solidity on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC91Dik_GqQhj-4ga6YS2n6A).

The purpose of the video is to show you how to use Web3 from your React Application.  We will see how to connect to an Ethereum Dapp via MetaMask using Web3 & React.

## After sending the message to other wallet address. We can decrypt the message at receiver's end using metamask's eth_decrypt function. Creating frontend code is the challenge for me at this point, as I am not well versed to write frontend code.

## Some logs are present in browser's dev tools log, as I was having trouble with putting them on frontend.
